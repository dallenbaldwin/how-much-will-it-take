How Much Will it Take?

A simple bun package to calculate how long it will
take to save up a 20% down-payment on a house

does not consider YOY increasing healthcare costs,
whether you plan to use investments to help save,
the savings rate of any accounts the savings may be 
held in before withdrawl

smart enough to estimate required taxes for the 
US 2023 tax year, but still simple at the end of
the day
